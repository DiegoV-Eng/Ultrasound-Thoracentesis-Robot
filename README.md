# Ultrasound-Thoracentesis-Robot
<div style="text-align: justify;">
This project presents the development of an advanced robotic system, guided by ultrasound imaging, to safely remove pleural effusion in a medical procedure known as thoracentesis. This technique aims to drain excess fluid that accumulates around the lungs, mitigating associated health risks. The following objectives were achieved:
</div>

• **Autonomous Robotic Control:** Developed an autonomous control system for the Franka Emika Panda robot using ROS, integrating vision and electronic algorithms for precise control.  

• **Ultrasound Image Processing:** Integrated a Python-based vision algorithm to process ultrasound images, utilizing Canny detection and segmentation techniques to accurately target the pleural zone.  
• **End-Effector Design and Fabrication:** Designed and fabricated a novel robotic end-effector for pleural effusion treatment composed by a needle insertion mechanism and a fluid aspiration module. Developed the embedded electronics and implemented control using Arduino.
